this is about a creative solution of network traffic analyzer device.  
it is based on the ASIC ethernet switch chip on shelf, providing the wire line speed of pkts generation and capture.  
it is totally different with existed implementation: 
neither the "hard" solution which based on FPGA, nor the "soft" solution based on linux + network adapter.  
the advantage comparing to other network traffic analyzer is:  
  1) it is capable to provide more ports in a single device with ability of wire speed pkts handling
  2) it is cheaper, reuse existing ethernet switch box, turn it into network analyzer simply by software replacement.
